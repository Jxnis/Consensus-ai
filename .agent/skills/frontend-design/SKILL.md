# Frontend Design Skill

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## Design Thinking
Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. 
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

## Aesthetic Guidelines
- **Typography**: Unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font. Avoid Inter/Arial/system defaults unless specifically styling them uniquely.
- **Color**: Dominant colors with sharp accents. Use CSS variables. Avoid "safe" purple gradients on white.
- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Focus on high-impact moments (staggered reveals).
- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Grid-breaking elements.

## Execution
Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices. No design should be the same. Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision.
