The purchase price is $80,000, and the repairs cost $50,000, so the total investment is $130,000.\n\nThe repairs are said to have increased the value by 150%. That means the value went up by 1.5 times the repair cost, which is 1.5 x $50,000 = $75,000. Adding that to the original purchase price gives a new value of $80,000 + $75,000 = $155,000.\n\nIf the house is sold at this new value, the profit is the selling price minus the total investment: $155,000 - $130,000 = $25,000.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{25000}\n\\]",
