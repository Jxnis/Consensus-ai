Its mass is about 318 times that of Earth.\n4.  **Comparison to Other Giants:** While Saturn is also a gas giant and the second-largest planet, Jupiter is significantly larger and more massive. Saturn has a larger *volume* than Jupiter only because it's much less dense (it could theoretically float in water!), but Jupiter has a much larger *diameter* and vastly more *mass*.\n\n**Key Facts about Jupiter:**\n*   **Type:** Gas Giant (primarily hydrogen and helium).\n*   **Notable Feature:** Home to the **Great Red Spot**, a massive, centuries-old storm larger than Earth.\n*   **Moons:** Has at least 95 known moons, including the four large Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto). Ganymede is even larger than the planet Mercury.\n\nSo, whether you measure by physical size (diameter/volume) or by mass, **Jupiter is definitively the largest planet in our solar system.**",

          "answer": "A **hexagon** has **6 sides**.  \n\nThis is true for all hexagons, whether they are **regular** (all sides and angles equal) or **irregular** (sides and angles of different lengths). The name comes from the Greek *hexa-* (meaning \"six\") and *-gon* (meaning \"angle\" or \"corner\").  \n\n**Example**:  \n- A regular hexagon (like a honeycomb cell) has 6 equal sides.  \n- An irregular hexagon (like a stretched or lopsided shape) still has 6 sides, but they may not be equal.  \n\nSo, regardless of its shape, **any hexagon always has 6 sides**. 🐝",
