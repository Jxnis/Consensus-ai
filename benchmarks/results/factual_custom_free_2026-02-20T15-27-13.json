          "answer": "The **atomic number of carbon is 6**.  \n\nThis means every carbon atom has **6 protons** in its nucleus, which defines it as carbon. The atomic number is fundamental to an element's identity and determines its position in the periodic table (carbon is element 6).  \n\n**Key point**:  \n- Atomic number = Number of protons (in a neutral atom, this also equals the number of electrons).  \n- Carbon's atomic mass (average mass of its isotopes) is approximately 12.01, but the **atomic number is always 6**.  \n\nThis is a core concept in chemistry and biology, as carbon is the backbone of organic molecules. 😊",
